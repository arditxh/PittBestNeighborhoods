# PittBestNeighborhoods
Ket-Hwa Cheng: flood zones: best neighborhoods are basiclly any neighborhood that has been floods: reasoning, floods mean less people,
thus leading to a "safer" enviorment.
I have added my files that are used for the floods, if we are adding that data to stacked bar graph per neighborhood, please merge via Hood
and then add through the neigh dataframe's ["is_flood"] which is a plus one to all flooded neighberhoods
