# PittBestNeighborhoods

## Team Safety

This repo uses three datasets; Arrests, Flood Zones, and Condemned Housing, to analyze and identify the “safest” neighborhood in Pittsburgh, PA.

**Ket-Hwa Cheng:** Flood Zones: best neighborhoods are basically any neighborhood that has been floods: reasoning, floods mean less people, thus leading to a "safer" environment. kec344@pitt.edu
